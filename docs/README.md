# Sign Setu: Documentation

Sign Setu is an offline Android app that helps a police officer communicate with a person who cannot be reached in words: a child or adult who is deaf, non-verbal, frightened, or speaks another language. The officer and the person share the officer's phone, or the person uses a paired second screen. The app is a communication aid; it is not an interpreter and it does not record or take statements.

| [../portal/](../portal/README.md) | Reviewer portal for content sign-off (static web page; not shipped in the app) |

### 1.3 Conventions

- Requirement, control, threat, risk and decision IDs (FR-, NFR-, SEC-, T-, P-, R-, D-) are stable. New items take new numbers; withdrawn IDs are not reused.
- **[confirm]** marks anything that depends on a person or body outside the team.
- Legal summaries come from public sources and are not legal advice.
- Sizes in MiB are binary (1 MiB = 1,048,576 bytes); sizes in MB are decimal.
- Diagrams are Mermaid source. Connectors use the `step` curve, so every line runs horizontally or vertically.

## 2. Overview

### 2.1 Purpose and scope

Sign Setu is one Android application with no server.

**In scope (Release 1):** officer panel; subject-facing stage with an animated character; questions, phrases and pictures in 17 languages; answers by touch, drawing, writing and signing to the camera; on-device sign recognition for Indian (ISL) and American (ASL) sign language; encrypted local session record; password-protected report; optional second screen over Bluetooth; reviewer portal for content sign-off.

**Out of scope:** any server or network service, cloud speech or translation, statement recording, case management, identity capture. These belong to a later release behind a project-owned gateway and would need a new threat model, privacy impact assessment and audit scope.

### 2.2 Stakeholders and users

| Role | Interest | Data flow model |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Police officer | Quick, defensible communication with the subject | E1 |
| Subject | To be understood without fear or confusion | E2 |
| Records custodian | A complete, protected record | E3 |
| Interpreter | Reached when a human interpreter is needed | E4 (contact link only) |
| Content reviewers | Correct signs, wording and child-safe content | Build pipeline, B3 |
| Release manager | Trustworthy releases; custody of the signing key | Build pipeline, B6, D8 |
| Security assessor | Verifiable controls | Section 6 |

Subject profiles decide what the subject sees and hears: young child, ISL user, hearing in another language, or not sure.

### 2.3 Session workflow

| Step | What happens | Controls |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Unlock | Device credential or strong biometric unlocks the app and the database key | NFR-31, SEC-20 to SEC-22 |
| 2 Set up | Officer picks profile, subject language (17), role, and ISL or ASL; the session is pinned to the screen | FR-05, FR-60, FR-88 |
| 3 Open | The stage greets the subject, then shows an introduction, ground rules and a practice round; each step needs only Next or Stop | FR-60, D-41 |
| 4 Ask | The officer shows prepared questions, phrases or pictures, or types text; typed English gets an instant Hindi caption marked unchecked | FR-10 to FR-21, D-44 |
| 5 Answer | The subject taps, draws, writes, uses a number pad or phrase board, or signs | FR-61 to FR-66 |
| 6 Confirm | A signed answer becomes two or three pictures per sign plus None of these; only the subject's tap records a meaning | FR-84 to FR-87, D-41 |
| 7 Record | Every event is written before the screen shows it; the officer sees how each answer was given | FR-30, FR-34, FR-91 |
| 8 End | Export an encrypted report, or end without export; data is purged and the database vacuumed | FR-06, FR-32, FR-33 |

### 2.4 Sign recognition

The camera is a mirror and records nothing outside a sign window (D-20). A sign window is opened by the subject's tap on Sign; it lasts 20 seconds for an answer and 3 minutes for an account. MediaPipe Holistic runs GPU first with CPU fallback. Readers: a 262-word ISL word reader, ISL and ASL spelling readers and an ASL word reader. The top three readings per sign, ranked by question context, are proposals only.

Process decomposition is in [section 3.4](#34-level-2-stage-interaction); the message sequence is in [section 4.5.1](#451-reading-a-signed-answer).

### 2.5 Reference configuration

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Target devices | Android 10 (API 29) or later, arm64-v8a only, 3 GB RAM or more, 5 to 6.9 inch portrait |
| Flavors | `standard` (reference, Bluetooth RFCOMM) and `nearby` (adds Nearby Connections) |
| Release package | Signed APK, about 79 MB, nothing compressed; float32 sign readers; native libraries stored uncompressed (NFR-05, D-42) |
| Permissions (standard) | `CAMERA` (mirror and sign window), `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` (second screen), `VIBRATE`. `INTERNET` only for the department gateway (D-47); no microphone or location (NFR-34, build gate) |
| Languages (17) | English, Hindi, Chhattisgarhi, Gondi, Halbi, Bengali, Nepali, Assamese, Odia, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Gujarati, Punjabi, Urdu |

## 3. Data flow

This section is the data flow model of Sign Setu Release 1. It shows how data enters, moves through, is stored by and leaves the system, and where trust changes. The runtime system is one offline Android application; the build pipeline is modelled separately. Out of scope for Release 1 and therefore not drawn: any server, network call, speech service or cloud translation (Release 1.1 behind a project gateway).

### 3.1 Notation

Gane-Sarson conventions. Processes are numbered; data stores are prefixed D; flows carry a unique ID and are drawn as orthogonal connectors. Each child diagram balances with its parent: every flow crossing a parent process boundary appears in the child.

| Element | Drawn as |
| --- | --- |
| External entity | Rectangle, white fill |
| Process | Rounded box, blue fill, numbered |
| Data store | Cylinder, tan fill, prefixed D |
| Trust boundary | Labelled subgraph (`TB0` to `TB3`) |
| Data flow | Labelled arrow, unique ID (F, G or H) |
| Later release | Dashed arrow and border (end-to-end view only) |

### 3.2 Context diagram (level 0)

The system and its six external entities.

### 3.4 Level 2: stage interaction

The sign path: camera frames reach the tracker only inside a sign window, landmarks live in memory only, and a reading is only ever a proposal until the subject taps a picture (3.7, 3.8). Boundary flows G1, G17, G19 and G4 are F18, F37, F22 and F34 of Figures 2a and 2b.

### 3.6 End-to-end view

One diagram for the whole system: how sign data and content are built and reviewed, how they ship inside the signed APK, and how, on the officer's phone, a question reaches the subject and the subject's answer, typed, tapped or signed, becomes a confirmed record. Everything inside TB1 runs on the phone with no network. Grey dashed marks a later release.

This view has its own numbering. Its processes 3.1 to 3.7 and entities E5 to E7 do not match the Level 1 and Level 2 numbers above; the IDs are local to this view.

### 3.7 Data dictionary

#### 3.7.1 External entities

| ID | Entity | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| E1 | Police officer | Holds the phone; unlocks the app, asks, reads the record, exports. |
| E2 | Subject | Person being helped; sees and hears the stage, answers by touch, drawing, writing or signing. |
| E3 | Records custodian | Receives the encrypted report through the Android share sheet, on the officer's action. |
| E4 | Messaging app | WhatsApp or Sandes; opened to a contact link for an interpreter call. No session data passes. |
| E5 | Stage device | Optional second phone or tablet showing the stage over bonded Bluetooth; stores nothing. |
| E6 | Department | Supplies configuration (interpreter contact, retention) and the optional assistant model file. |

#### 3.7.2 Processes

| ID | Process | Description | Code | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 5.0 | Export and hand off | Composes the PDF report, encrypts it under a one-time passphrase, shares it; opens the interpreter contact link. | export | FR-32, FR-94, SEC-10 to SEC-12 |
| 6.0 | Translate typed text | Rule-based English to Hindi caption on the phone (reviewed text, sentence patterns, word by word); optional on-device model with back-translation. | data.content.Translate, assistant | FR-68, SEC-65, D-24, D-44 |
| 7.0 | Link second screen | Pairs by commit-then-reveal ECDH; sends the stage view and receives answers over AES-256-GCM frames. | pair, ui.pair | FR-72 to FR-76, SEC-66 to SEC-70 |
| 8.0 | Purge on retention | Deletes sessions after the retention period (default 24 h) and runs VACUUM; resets on a build expiry. | data.session (WorkManager) | FR-33, FR-67 |

#### 3.7.3 Processes of 3.0

| ID | Process | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3.1 | Resolve content, plan signs | Looks up the question, picture, motion and caption; plans typed text into signs, recorded signs first. |
| 3.2 | Present on stage | Draws the character, caption, held picture and answer inputs; plays speech. |
| 3.3 | Capture touch input | Taps, drawing, writing, number pads and the phrase board. |
| 3.4 | Track landmarks | MediaPipe Holistic on camera frames, only while a sign window is open. |
| 3.5 | Segment signs | Cuts the landmark stream into signs by pauses; keeps a skeleton for replay. |
| 3.6 | Read signs | ISL word reader, ISL and ASL spelling, ASL word reader; top three per sign. |
| 3.7 | Propose choices | Ranks guesses by question context; builds two or three pictures per sign plus None of these. |
| 3.8 | Confirm and validate | Only the subject's own tap makes a meaning the answer; checks the input and records the method. |

### 3.8 Trust boundaries

Control definitions are in [section 6](#6-security).

| ID | Boundary | Controls |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TB0 | Stage on the shared screen | Pinned full screen; officer notes, log and machine readings never drawn; camera analysed only inside a sign window; landmarks in RAM only (D6); a machine reading becomes the subject's only when the subject picks it (3.8). |
| TB1 | Officer's phone, app sandbox | Storage SEC-01 to SEC-08 (D1, 8.0); authentication SEC-20 to SEC-22 (1.0, D4); no network SEC-30; platform SEC-40 to SEC-46; content and model hashes SEC-62 (D2, D5). |
| TB2 | Bluetooth link to a stage device | SEC-66 to SEC-70 (7.0): bonded devices, authenticated key agreement, encrypted frames; the stage device stores nothing. |
| TB3 | Build and release | SEC-50 to SEC-54: open licences only (CC BY 4.0, Apache-2.0, MIT), content review before release (B3), verified dependencies, CI scans, offline signing key (D8). |

## 4. Architecture

Context, logical, runtime, data, key and deployment views of the application, its reviewer portal and its delivery pipeline. Data movement and trust boundaries are in [section 3](#3-data-flow).

### 4.1 Notation

Arrows point from caller to callee or from source to destination and are drawn as orthogonal connectors. Fill indicates the element kind.

| Kind | Fill | Border |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Component (`comp`) | Blue | Dark blue |
| Data (`data`) | Tan | Brown |
| Security-relevant (`sec`) | Green | Dark green |
| External (`ext`) | White | Ink |

### 4.2 System context

Sign Setu Release 1 is one Android application. It needs no server; an optional department gateway is used only when the build has one and the phone is online (D-47). Content, vision and sign-reader models ship in the signed APK; session data stays in an encrypted database until the officer exports or clears it. An optional second phone shows the stage over Bluetooth and stores nothing. A static reviewer portal supports content sign-off and is not part of the app.

### 4.3 Layered architecture

The interface never writes state directly: every action becomes an event written to the database first, and the screen updates from that write.

### 4.6 Data and keys

#### 4.6.1 Data model

No column holds a name, address, phone number or photograph. Database version 3; a downgrade drops the tables and the officer is notified, because sessions live a day at most.

### 4.8 Technology stack

| Layer | Choice | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Language, UI | Kotlin 2.4.21, Jetpack Compose (BOM 2026.09), Material 3 | Native build; direct access to Keystore and platform security APIs |
| Platform | minSdk 29, compileSdk and targetSdk 37; AGP 9.4.1 | Android 10 floor |
| Database | Room 2.8.5 with SQLCipher 4.19.1 | Encrypted at rest |
| Settings, work | DataStore 1.2.1, WorkManager 2.12 | No personal data; retention purge |
| Camera, vision | CameraX 1.6.2; MediaPipe Tasks Vision 1.1.1 (Holistic); protobuf-javalite 4.36.2 | Hands, face and pose on the phone; 64-bit only |
| Sign readers | LandmarkSignReader in plain Kotlin; float32 weights in the APK | No inference library to audit; nothing quantised |
| Characters | Compose Canvas 2D rig, keyframe motion files | No video; one motion file plays on both characters |
| Audio | Media3 ExoPlayer 1.11.1, Opus | Normal and reduced speed |
| Assistant | llama.cpp v0.5.0 via NDK and CMake (optional GGUF model) | Offline translation with back-translation |
| Export | PdfDocument, PdfBox-Android 2.0.27.0, BouncyCastle 1.86 | AES-256 encrypted report |
| Second screen | Bluetooth RFCOMM; Nearby Connections only in the `nearby` flavor | No network, scanning or location in the reference build |
| Build | Gradle 9.8.1, version catalog, R8 full mode, dependency verification, lockfile | Supply-chain control; nothing compressed for size |
| Portal | Vite+, React 19, TypeScript 7 | Static, no backend |

### 4.9 Quality attributes and tactics

| Attribute | Tactic | Trace |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Confidentiality | Key hierarchy (Figure 8); sandbox with no network permission | SEC-01 to SEC-08, SEC-20 to SEC-22, SEC-30, SEC-40 |
| Integrity of meaning | Machine readings are proposals; only the subject's tap makes an answer; evidence grades keep what was shown and how it was given | FR-66, FR-86, FR-91 |
| Auditability | Write before show; every event, method and shown item is recorded; the report carries the not-a-statement notice | FR-34, FR-94 |
| Supply chain | Lockfile and verification metadata, content manifest hashes, signed APK, CI scans | SEC-50 to SEC-52 |
| Performance | Camera analysis only inside a sign window; each model loaded and checked on first use | NFR-01, NFR-02, NFR-06 |
| Accessibility | 48 dp targets, 4.5:1 contrast, 200% font scale, TalkBack, automated accessibility checks in CI | NFR-20 to NFR-23 |
| Availability offline | No server dependency; every asset ships in the APK; each optional asset degrades alone | D-15 |

### 4.10 Content bundle structure

All content is data, not code, and every file except `models/` is checked against `manifest.json` (SHA-256) each time the bundle loads. A file that fails its hash is never parsed or shown. A failed picture, recording or motion file is left out; any other failed JSON file stops new sessions. Each model is checked by its own loader on first use. Each ASL asset is optional and degrades alone.

| Path | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `triage.json` | 15 question groups, 78 questions with text per language, cards, roles |
| `cards.json`, `cards/*.webp` | 12 categories, 117 picture cards |
| `gestures.json`, `signs.json` | 42 authored gestures; letters, digits and draft word signs |
| `isl_signs.json`, `asl_signs.json` | 262 ISL and 250 ASL recorded signs retargeted from INCLUDE, ISLRTC and PopSign signers |
| `words.json`, `lexicon.json` | 222 vocabulary entries; 33 gesture-lookup entries |
| `languages.json`, `subject_ui.json` | 17 languages in their own scripts; stage words per language |
| `phrases.json`, `places.json` | Sentence patterns; 36 states and union territories |
| `audio/<lang>/*.ogg` | Placeholder speech, Opus, mono (1,350 files) |
| `models/` | Holistic landmarker, ISL word reader, ISL and ASL spelling readers, ASL word reader |

## 5. Requirements, design and data protection

### 5.1 Requirements

Requirements are numbered and traced to controls, tests and decisions. The register is [01-requirements.md](01-requirements.md).

| Category | Count | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Functional (FR) | 98 in the register; Release 1 items are those not listed under later releases | FR-34 write before show; FR-66 show-back confirmation; FR-86 the subject owns meaning |
| Non-functional (NFR) | 26 | NFR-01 start under 2 s; NFR-05 APK under 100 MB; NFR-20 touch targets 48 dp |
| Security (SEC) | 47 controls | SEC-40 screen capture blocked; SEC-71 landmarks in RAM only |

#### 5.1.1 Key non-functional targets

| ID | Target | Verified by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NFR-01 | Cold start to usable officer state under 2 s | Device timing on the oldest test device |
| NFR-02 | Preset question on the stage within 300 ms | Device timing; item logged then drawn |
| NFR-05 | APK under 100 MB at full precision, nothing compressed | Release build size check |
| NFR-06 | Memory under 300 MB per session | Profiler on device |
| NFR-20 to NFR-23 | Touch targets, contrast, 200% font scale, TalkBack | Espresso accessibility checks (CI), manual TalkBack pass |
| NFR-30 to NFR-37 | Encryption at rest, credential, no screenshots, no backup, no network, no analytics | Build gate, SEC tests, code review |

### 5.2 Design

#### 5.2.1 Principles

- **Offline first.** No feature depends on a network; online use is optional and falls back on any failure (D-47).
- **Content is data.** Questions, cards, translations and motions are versioned asset files under review, not code.
- **Write before show.** The database is written first; the screen follows.
- **The subject owns meaning.** A reading is a proposal; the subject's tap is the answer.
- **Small and boring.** One module, platform libraries first, no frameworks the audit must justify.

#### 5.2.2 Technology choice: Kotlin and Jetpack Compose

Native Kotlin was chosen over cross-platform frameworks (D-01) because the product is a camera-and-security application: it runs MediaPipe and the sign readers on every frame, ships native C++ libraries, must declare no INTERNET permission, and relies on Android Keystore, SQLCipher, BiometricPrompt, screen pinning and FLAG_SECURE. Each of these is first-class in Kotlin and would need a native bridge elsewhere. The cost is that an iOS version would be a rewrite; Release 1 targets officers' Android phones.

#### 5.2.3 Content and localisation

| Aspect | Design |
| --- | --- |
| Bundle | Structure, counts and integrity rules: [section 4.10](#410-content-bundle-structure) |
| Subject text | Every stage word, question, phrase and picture label exists in all 17 languages (D-43); speech exists for English, Hindi and most others as placeholder voices; Gondi and Halbi have none |
| Hindi caption | Typed English is captioned on the phone: reviewed wording first, then sentence patterns, then word by word; returns nothing rather than a wrong modal verb (D-44) |
| Review | Every sign and question passes the reviewer portal before release; drafts are labelled |

#### 5.2.4 Design decisions

The decision register (D-01 to D-44) holds the reasoning for each choice. [Appendix A](#appendix-a-decision-summary) lists them.

### 5.3 Data and privacy

| Data | Where | Retention | Exit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Session events, drawings, typed answers | Encrypted database (D1) | Purged after the retention period (default 24 h, 4 to 72 h) or on ending the session | Encrypted PDF only, on officer action |
| Landmarks of signed answers | View-model memory (D6) | Wiped at end, lock and clear | None |
| Camera frames | Memory, inside a sign window | Not stored | None |
| Settings, interpreter contact | DataStore | Until cleared | None |
| Export passphrase | Shown once on screen | Not stored | Officer shares it separately |

The database has no column for the subject's name, address, phone number or photograph. Lesson-sheet answers can hold such details; they live in the same encrypted rows and reach only the encrypted report.

- No analytics, advertising or crash-reporting SDK; MediaPipe usage statistics are blocked at build time (D-33, SEC-72).
- Every exported page carries a notice that the report is not a statement (FR-94).

#### 5.3.1 Legal and policy context

DPDP Act 2023 and Rules 2025; Juvenile Justice Act 2015 section 74; POCSO Act sections 24 and 26; BNSS sections 38, 47, 48, 53, 58, 173 and 183; BSA section 125; Constitution Article 20(3); RPwD Act with IS 17802. Rights notices are shown to the subject as statements; a Yes under a right is never offered. The department confirms the application identifier and the legal wording before production.

## 6. Security

Objectives: subject data is unreadable without the officer's credential; it does not leak through backups, screenshots, logs, notifications, the clipboard or other apps; only an encrypted report or a contact link leaves the phone, on explicit action; every release is built from reviewed code, scanned and traceable.

| Family | Controls (summary) | IDs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Storage | SQLCipher database; DEK wrapped by a Keystore KEK; no backup; purge with VACUUM; drawings only inside the database | SEC-01 to SEC-08 |
| Cryptography | Platform and SQLCipher cryptography only; AES-256 report with an 80-bit one-time passphrase and a record digest on every page; P-256 ECDH, HKDF-SHA256, AES-256-GCM link frames | SEC-10 to SEC-12, SEC-67, SEC-76 |
| Authentication | Secure device lock required; BiometricPrompt (strong biometric or device credential); KEK usable only while the phone is unlocked (D-48) | SEC-20 to SEC-22 |
| Network | HTTPS to the one gateway host only, cleartext refused; the build fails if any variant's merged manifest declares RECORD_AUDIO; no WebView | SEC-30, SEC-43 |
| Platform | FLAG_SECURE; only the launcher exported; overlay-touch filter; screen pinning; no notifications with subject data; no clipboard of session data | SEC-06, SEC-40 to SEC-46 |
| Camera and landmarks | Analysis only in a sign window; landmarks in RAM; narratives drop face points | SEC-47, SEC-71 |
| Supply chain | Dependency lockfile and verification metadata; SBOM; Lint, semgrep, osv-scanner, gitleaks; content manifest checked before use; offline signing key | SEC-50 to SEC-54, SEC-62 |
| Resilience | R8 full mode; rooted or test-key device warns the officer and disables history (department to confirm); build expiry 180 days; unreadable database deleted on key loss | SEC-60, SEC-63, SEC-64 |
| Second screen | Bonded devices only; commit-then-reveal; typed code and check number; stage device stores nothing | SEC-66 to SEC-70 |

### 6.1 Threats addressed

| Threat | Main control |
| --- | --- |
| Lost, stolen or seized phone | Encrypted store and credential; retention purge |
| Screenshot, recording, recents thumbnail | FLAG_SECURE |
| Rogue or relayed second screen | Commit-then-reveal pairing, check number, AEAD frames |
| Machine reading taken as the subject's answer | Subject confirmation; evidence grades |
| Compromised dependency or key | Lockfile, verification metadata, scans, offline signing key |
| App used as a statement-taking tool | No statement feature; not-a-statement notices |

## 7. Quality assurance

### 7.1 Strategy

- Unit tests for content, logic, record, crypto, translation and sign pipeline (JVM, both flavors).
- Instrumented tests on an Android 14 emulator: stage accessibility in light and dark themes, end-to-end stage flow, migrations, export.
- Pipeline test on device: real dictionary clips through MediaPipe, segmentation and the reader.
- Portal tests (React, TypeScript) and Python tool tests for the build tooling.
- Security gates in CI: semgrep, osv-scanner on the shipped runtime lockfile, gitleaks.

### 7.2 Continuous integration

Every push to `main` runs these jobs.

| Job | Checks |
| --- | --- |
| android | Unit tests, release lint, release and nearby builds |
| instrumented | Stage accessibility tests on an API 34 pixel_6 emulator |
| release-record | Release APK and bundle, dependency and vulnerability record |
| portal, tools | Portal format, lint and tests; Python tool tests |
| semgrep, osv, gitleaks | Code patterns, known vulnerabilities in shipped libraries, secrets |

### 7.3 Results at this baseline

| Measure | Result |
| --- | --- |
| CI | All eight jobs pass on the baseline commit |
| Unit tests | 201 per flavor passed locally; instrumented suite passed locally (76 of 76 at last full run) |
| Portal tests | 918 passed |
| Release smoke test | Signed 0.4.2 APK installs and runs on an arm64 phone and on the emulator without a crash |
| Pipeline test (3 dictionary clips) | Hands and pose tracked in line with the desktop run; each clip segmented; true word in the top three for 2 of 3 clips |

### 7.4 Sign reader accuracy

Measured values, not targets.

| Reader | Data | Top-1 | Top-3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ISL words (262) | Signers seen in training (n=816) | 0.979 | 0.995 |
| ISL words | A new signer, ISLRTC dictionary clips (n=199) | 0.286 | 0.442 |
| ASL words | Held-out PopSign signers | 0.402 | n/a |
| ISL letters, digits | Real signers, small samples (n=23 letters, n=10 digits) | 0.13 letters, 0.80 digits | 0.30, 1.00 |

The reader generalises poorly to people it has not seen. For that reason a reading is never recorded as an answer, every signed answer is confirmed by the subject from pictures, and the officer sees both the reading and the confirmation. Closing the gap needs recorded signs from many real signers, including children and the core answer words (yes, no, water, pain, help, stop, don't know).

## 8. Build, release and operation

### 8.1 Build and configuration management

| Topic | Practice |
| --- | --- |
| Source control | Git; `main` is the integration branch; the repository is public |
| Reproducibility | Gradle wrapper, version catalog, dependency lockfile and checksum verification; vendored llama.cpp at a pinned version; `.gitattributes` forces LF so manifest hashes hold on every checkout |
| Release build | R8 full mode with resource shrinking, not debuggable, log calls stripped, arm64 only; zipalign and apksigner with the release key (signature scheme v3). The key is held offline by the release manager and a second custodian |
| Versioning | Semantic version in `app/build.gradle.kts` (0.4.2, code 6); a build refuses new sessions 180 days after its build date |
| Distribution | GitHub release asset for pilots; Mobile Seva AppStore or a department download page for production |

### 8.2 Installation and operation

| Topic | Guidance |
| --- | --- |
| Install | Allow installs from the source, open the APK, accept the camera permission. The phone must have a screen lock; the app refuses to store sessions without one |
| Use | Unlock, choose profile and language, start. The officer holds the phone with the stage facing the subject |
| Export | End session, Export, share the PDF, then give the one-time passphrase by a different channel; finish and delete |
| Update | Install the newer APK over the old one; updates must carry the same signing key |
| Shared phone risk | End each conversation; rely on retention; a department PIN can be added if the pilot shows shared phones |

## 9. Risks, limitations and traceability

### 9.1 Risks, limitations and open items

| Item | Impact | Mitigation or action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sign reader accuracy on unseen signers | Wrong proposals | Subject confirmation from pictures; evidence grades; collect real signer data |
| Translations beyond English and Hindi are drafts | Wrong wording shown to a subject | Labelled draft; native-speaker review before production |
| Gondi and Halbi have low confidence and no speech | Weak support for these languages | Review with speakers; record voices |
| Placeholder speech is synthetic | Unnatural voices | Replace with recorded speech |
| Hindi caption patterns are rules, not a model | Odd sentences for unusual input | No caption is better than a wrong one; marked unchecked; extend patterns after review |
| Android only, arm64 only | No iOS or 32-bit phones | Accepted scope for officers' phones |
| Not yet tested with children and on a spread of phones | Unknown field behaviour | Pilot devices and user testing (TC-05, PT-01 to PT-05) |
| Signing key password handling | Key custody | Rotate the keystore password; keep the file offline |
| Formal reviews outstanding | No assurance claim yet | Content review record sign-off; CERT-In empanelled audit; MASVS review |

### 9.2 Traceability

| Area | Requirements | Design | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Session record | FR-30 to FR-34, FR-91 | SessionViewModel, data.session, ER model (Figure 7) | LogicTest, ConversationE2ETest, SessionMigrationTest |
| Stage and answers | FR-60 to FR-66, FR-101 to FR-107 | ui.session stage, ui.avatar | StageLogicTest, StageAccessibilityTest |
| Sign recognition | FR-84 to FR-87, FR-109 to FR-112 | camera, sign (Figure 4) | SignReaderTest, SignIngestionTest, SegmentTest, SignPipelineDeviceTest |
| Export | FR-32, FR-94, FR-104 | export (Figure 8) | ReportExportDeviceTest |
| Second screen | FR-72 to FR-76 | pair (Figure 6) | PairCryptoTest, protocol test TC-41 |
| Security | NFR-30 to NFR-37, SEC-01 to SEC-76 | Layers, key hierarchy, DFD trust boundaries | Permission gate, CI scans, security tests |
| Translation | FR-68, D-44 | data.content.Translate | TranslateTest |
